    <b><p class="oasif" style="background-color:rgb(192, 185, 185);">The 20-year-old French-Algerian rookie has wasted no time standing out. He had a rocky start in Melbourne, where he crashed on the formation lap, but has since emerged as one of the most talked-about newcomers on the grid, with Q3 appearances in China and Japan, as well as points finishes in Japan and Saudi Arabia. His speed and consistency have already earned praise from Red Bull advisor Helmut Marko, who called him "the surprise of the season".</p>
    <p class="ahmed" style="background-color: bisque;">Asked about his main rival in karting, Hadjar didn’t hesitate to name Sami Meguetounif, now racing in Formula 2. "He's a good friend of mine probably my best friend in motorsport. We had a lot of battles together in the national championships. But always enjoyable ones."</p>
    <p class="rikto" style="background: goldenrod;">With Red Bull’s support, Hadjar stepped up to F3 in 2022. He won two sprint races and one feature race, and finished fourth in the standings, earning promotion to F2 the following year. In 2023, he also had his Friday practice sessions in F1: in Mexico for AlphaTauri and in Abu Dhabi for Red Bull.</p>
