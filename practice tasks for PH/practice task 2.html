    <P class="p1">After five races in six weeks, the paddock got a well-earned chance to catch its breath a little before the next trip, which sees a return to one of the newest venues on the calendar. With a new championship leader and some drivers searching for answers, there’s no shortage of talking points heading to Miami…</P>
    <P class="p2">A third victory in the first five races this season has seen Oscar Piastri become the new championship leader at this early stage, marking the first time he has topped the standings in Formula 1.

        It has been a very impressive start to the year for the Australian, who bounced back quickly from the disappointment of ending up ninth in his home race to kick-off the season, and has scored 97 points out of a possible 108 since.</P>
    <P class="p3">But one thing the Melbourne result did was set Piastri up to be in recovery mode, looking to chip away at the early advantage team mate Lando Norris had built up. Now he’s achieved that, he becomes the driver the rest of the chasing pack are all focusing on, as he sits at the top of the standings.</P>
